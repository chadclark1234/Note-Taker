## Description

Note Taker is a project that uses NodeJS and modules Express, File System and UID. The application is hosted on Heroku. It allows the user to enter and save notes which can be re-displayed by clicking on the note title. The user can also erase each note as they choose.

## Challenges

This was my first application that required a server and custom built API's. The most challenging part for me was getting the folder structure and url pathways correct.
